# -----------------------------------------------
# Ignore specific large model files and types
# -----------------------------------------------

# 1. Ignore all Keras H5/SavedModel files
*.keras

# 2. Ignore all ONNX files
*.onnx

# 3. Ignore all general data files inside the 'homework' folder (like the 76MB file)
# This assumes that other *.data files in this folder are also models/data.
09-serverless/homework/*.data

# 4. Ignore the entire 'variables' directory generated by a Keras SavedModel format
# This is a safe way to ignore the 160MB file which is part of this directory structure.
09-serverless/keras/models/*/variables/
